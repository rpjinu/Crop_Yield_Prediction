The dataset includes historical weather data, soil properties, and crop yield records, enabling researchers and developers to build robust models for predicting crop yields.

Dataset Contents:-
Crop_Yield.csv: This file contains the main dataset with the following columns:
Region: The geographical area where the crop yield data was collected.\
Year: The year of the recorded data.\
Crop_Type: The type of crop.\
Yield: The yield of the crop per unit area.\
Temperature: Average temperature during the growing season.\
Precipitation: Total precipitation during the growing season.\
Soil_Type: Type of soil in the region.\
Soil_pH: pH value of the soil.\
Fertilizer_Use: Amount of fertilizer used per unit area.\
Irrigation: Type and amount of irrigation used.\
README.md: This file provides an overview and details about the dataset, including the structure and relevant information for using the dataset.\
#Usage:-
Prerequisites
To use this dataset, you need to have a working knowledge of data analysis and machine learning techniques. Familiarity with Python and data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn is recommended.

#Loading the Data:-
You can load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame using the following code:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('Crop_Yield.csv')
Exploratory Data Analysis
Before building predictive models, it's essential to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and distribution of the data. Here are a few steps you can follow:

Summary Statistics:

python
Copy code
print(data.describe())
Data Visualization:
Utilize libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize relationships and trends in the data.

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.pairplot(data)
plt.show()
Predictive Modeling
You can use various machine learning algorithms to predict crop yields. Here's a simple example using a Linear Regression model:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Prepare the data
X = data[['Temperature', 'Precipitation', 'Soil_pH', 'Fertilizer_Use']]
y = data['Yield']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate:-
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
